### 🔭 Software Engineer @ [CreateFuture](https://createfuture.com/about/) 
##### _October 2023 - Present_

##### The pitch 👇

> _At CreateFuture we don’t believe in templated solutions or overhyped promises.
We believe in the transformational power of digital. Rock-solid outcomes that take hard work, commitment and ingenuity.
With a team of over 500 experts (and growing fast) and 5+ UK locations, we know what it takes to tackle challenges and create solutions. As with our past clients, we’re determined to get you exactly what you need._

##### What am I working on right now? 👨‍💻

I'm working as a Sofware Engineer on a large project for our client [Tombola](https://www.tombola.co.uk/). Alongside 2 other Software Engineers from CreateFuture, I am in an embedded team building out microservices to help Tombola decouple its architecture. All our services are .NET Minimal APIs and aim to follow Clean Architecture principles. 

As well as working on client projects I write for our tech publication on Medium: [The Tech Collective](https://medium.com/the-tech-collective). 

We are [hiring](https://grnh.se/775248c2teu) 📢 👋

## Short Term Goal
🌱 My goal for the next few months is to work through the [.NET Developer Roadmap by Nick Chapsas](https://roadmap.sh/r?id=65d8624e66cd6d03d2d7efc9)

Using the public [Open Brewery DB API](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) I am going to build out a mature, modern .NET API step-by-step. I plan to incorporate many of the technologies referenced in the roadmap. 

Each step will be written up on Medium with a supporting repository published here. 😬
